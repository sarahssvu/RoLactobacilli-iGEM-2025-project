  **Alzheimers Disease iGEM 2025 Project**

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **RoLactobacilli iGEM 2025 project!** This repository houses all documentation, protocols, meeting notes, and updates relevant to our project.

## 📌 Project Overview

**WHAT IS OUR PROJECT?** 

<aside>
💡

To stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, we aim to prevent the abnormal buildup of proteins in and around brain cells. We plan to deliver a naturally occurring enzyme that breaks down amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles directly into the human brain, specifically targeting the hippocampus, to prevent these damaging accumulations at their source. These neurofibrillary tangles block the neuron’s transport system, harming the synaptic communication between neurons.

# Style Guide for Documentation

To keep things consistent and readable, follow these rules:

## 🗂 Folder Naming
- Use lowercase and hyphens (`-`) for folder and file names.
  - ✓ `meeting-notes`, `protocols`
  - 𐄂 `MeetingNotes`, `Protocol_1`

## 📝 Text Formatting
- Use headings consistently: `# Title`, `## Section`, `### Subsection`
- Use bullet points for lists, and `**bold**` for emphasis.
- Always include a date at the top of notes and protocols.

## 🧪 Scientific Content
- Include units (e.g., µL, mg/mL).
- Define abbreviations on first use.
- Link sources or literature references where applicable.

## 🔁 Versioning
- Save major updates as new versions or new files (e.g., `protocol-v2.md`).
- Minor edits can be committed directly to the same file.
